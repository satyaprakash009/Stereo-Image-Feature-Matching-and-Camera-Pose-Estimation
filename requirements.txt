# Stereo Image Feature Detection and Camera Pose Estimation

This project demonstrates feature detection and matching between two stereo images using ORB, and estimates the camera pose based on matched features.

## Requirements

- **OpenCV**: Version 4.x or later (with features2d, calib3d, core modules).
- **C++ Compiler**: A C++11 compatible compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang, MSVC).
- **CMake**: (Optional) for building the project.

## Installation

### OpenCV Installation

- **Ubuntu**: `sudo apt-get install libopencv-dev`
- **Windows**: [Download OpenCV](https://opencv.org/releases/) and set up in your environment.
- **macOS**: `brew install opencv`

### Build Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```
2. Build with CMake (optional):
   ```bash
   mkdir build && cd build
   cmake ..
   make
   ```
3. Run the executable:
   ```bash
   ./StereoPoseEstimation
   ```

## Usage

- Place your stereo images (`left_image.png` and `right_image.png`) in the project directory.
- Run the executable as shown above.

## Notes

- **Camera Calibration**: Adjust the intrinsic matrix (`K`) in the code for your specific camera.
- **Ground Truth Pose**: The code uses an identity matrix as a placeholder.
